Their seasonal migrations included hunting, fishing, and growing a variety of crops, but they returned to their longhouses during the winter. Abenaki built birch-bark canoes for water travel.\n\nThis tribal group includes the Penobscot and the Androscoggin. Abenakis fought against the English on the side of the French during the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763. After their defeat, many went north where they were welcomed by the French with gifts of land, and presently, there is a reserve in Saint Francis, Quebec."

They cultivated two kinds of tobacco—medicine tobacco used in ceremonies and everyday tobacco.\n\nIn the 19th Century, the Crow allied with the United States, and fought on the side of the U.S. in various conflicts against the Cheyenne, Arapahos, and Sioux. Today, the Crow Nation has the largest reservation in the state of Montana, 1.5 million acres."

They were active traders with Pueblo tribes to the east and west and with Aztecs and Mayans to the south.\n\nAcoma Pueblo is also known as Sky City because of its location high atop a 370-foot tall mesa. A mesa is a flat-topped hill with sheer cliff sides formed by differential erosion. Mesa means \"table\" in Spanish.\n\nThe Acoma have historically been allied with the Laguna tribe. That alliance survives today. Their reservations border each other and they share many resources between them, including a high school. The Acoma have been master potters for 2000 years."

They built light, flexible boats called kayaks. Aleuts built and lived in underground houses called barabaras. Barabaras were camouflaged to blend in with the surrounding ground, making them almost undetectable.\n\nAleuts made jewelry out of ivory, bone and feathers. Aleuts developed techniques for surviving harsh arctic winters. During the summers the Aleuts would travel inland to fish for salmon and live in temporary dwellings.\n\nToday Aleuts still live in Alaska, where 44 million acres of federal land was set aside for Alaska's Inuit and Aleut populations."

Thick white clouds float delicately by, filled to capacity with burgeoning cloud blossoms.\n\nFun  Fact: Anemone's name comes from the Greek word for the four winds: Anemoi.

Some believe that the word ‘Ojibwa' is derived from ‘o-jib-i-weg' which means, \"Those who Make Pictographs.\" Anisinabe also practiced the Sun Dance.\n\nAnisinabe did not move around as much as other tribes. They built wigwams and also made birch-bark canoes. Their society was organized around clans named for totem animals. The Anisinabe term is \"dodem\".\n\nToday, there are Anisinabe reservations in the states of Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Montana, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan."

They fully accept who they are and embrace their differences. With the best qualities of cats, foxes, and bats, they are highly adaptable to their surroundings: climbing, running, and flying with equal mastery. In addition, flitkits love to inspire others to think beyond the possible and frequently pop up where they are least expected. They are also fascinated by anything that is creative, different, and goes against the grain. The cunning flitkit teaches us that living creatures have amazing potential and no cage that can hold intelligence and creativity.\n\n The horse Tricksy is right at home with her magical friends and shares much of their coloring. She also loves to inspire and encourage thinking outside the box and coloring outside the lines."

Clay for the pottery was dug after giving ritual thanks to the Earth Mother. It was first ground, and then sifted and mixed with water. After the clay was shaped into a vessel, it was scraped smooth with a scraper. Then a thin layer of finer clay was applied to the surface for extra smoothness. Then the vessel was polished with a stone. After the piece was painted with home-made organic dyes using a yucca brush, the pottery was fired in kilns. During the firing, silence was observed in order to maintain the original \"voice\" of the \"being\" of the clay and its intended purpose. Selling pottery and other traditional arts and crafts is a major source of income for many of the Zuni, and an artisan may be the sole financial support for their immediate family as well as others. They make pottery, clothing, baskets, and Kachina dolls.\n\nThe cultural life of the Zuni people revolves around their religion, which is unique from the other Pueblo peoples. They venerate three deities: Earth Mother, Sun Father and Moonlight Giving Mother. They make barefoot pilgrimages and engage in ceremonies honoring birth, coming of age, marriage and death.\n\nZuni culture has always been extremely placid and tranquil. They have earned a status in the popular culture of the West as a profoundly spiritual and peaceful people."
